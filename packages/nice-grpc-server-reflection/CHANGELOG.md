### Bug Fixes

- **nice-grpc-server-reflection:** make server reflection lossless
  ([#811](https://github.com/deeplay-io/nice-grpc/issues/811))
  ([313371e](https://github.com/deeplay-io/nice-grpc/commit/313371e60a20409891cf1cb5b0701a472061adfc))

## [3.0.0](https://github.com/deeplay-io/nice-grpc/compare/nice-grpc-server-reflection@2.0.14...nice-grpc-server-reflection@3.0.0) (2025-04-30)

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

- **nice-grpc-server-reflection:** server reflection is now exposed via
  `grpc.reflection.v1.ServerReflection` service instead of
  `grpc.reflection.v1alpha.ServerReflection`. Tools like grpcurl should handle
  this automatically.

### Features

- **nice-grpc-server-reflection:** use v1 protobufs
  ([#765](https://github.com/deeplay-io/nice-grpc/issues/765))
